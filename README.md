Quick sketch of a modular clearomizer holder to be cut on a laser cutter.

The small and large holes respectively have a 7mm or 20mm diameter and are intended to
fit a Joyetech Exceed D19 clearomizer. The panel file is meant to cut 2 holders and the
joint parts in plates of 3mm thick material. Two small holes boards and one large will be
cut for each holder along with the joints. The boards must then be stacked and glue to
finalize the holder.
