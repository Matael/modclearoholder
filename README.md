# Modular Clearomizer Holder

Quick sketch of a modular clearomizer holder to be cut on a laser cutter.

# Panel & Instruction

The small and large holes respectively have 7mm and 20mm diameters to fit a Joyetech Exceed D19 clearomizer.
you may cut or scale the design using the `base.dxf` file.

The panel file is meant to cut 2 holders and the joint parts in plates of 3mm thick material. Two boards with small holes and one with a large one will be
cut for each holder along with the joints. The boards must then be stacked and glued together to finalize the holder.

## Exemple of realisation

Cut on a RobotSeed lasercutter.
